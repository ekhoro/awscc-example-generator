# Sample Generated Examples

This directory contains examples of Terraform files generated using the AWSCC context with Amazon Q.

## Files

- `scheduler_schedule_group.tf` - EventBridge Scheduler schedule group example
- `appconfig_deployment.tf` - AppConfig deployment example (shows AWSCC + AWS provider usage)
- `logs_log_group.tf` - CloudWatch log group example

## How These Were Generated

Each file was generated by asking Amazon Q:
```
Generate usage example for awscc_[resource_name]
```

For example:
- `Generate usage example for awscc_scheduler_schedule_group`
- `Generate usage example for awscc_appconfig_deployment`
- `Generate usage example for awscc_logs_log_group`

## Note on Mixed Provider Examples

The `appconfig_deployment.tf` example shows how some AWSCC resources require supporting resources from the standard AWS provider. This is common for complex services where the AWSCC resource represents the final deployment step.

## Validation

All examples in this directory have been validated with:
```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
```

## Usage

You can use these as references for:
- Understanding the expected output format
- Comparing your generated examples
- Learning AWSCC resource patterns
- Seeing how AWSCC and AWS providers work together

## Testing

To test any example:
1. Copy the `.tf` file to a new directory
2. Run `terraform init`
3. Run `terraform validate`
4. Run `terraform plan`
5. Optionally run `terraform apply` (remember to `terraform destroy` afterward)
