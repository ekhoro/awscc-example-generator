# Sample Generated Examples

This directory contains examples of Terraform files generated using the AWSCC context with Amazon Q.

## Files

- `appconfig_deployment.tf` - AppConfig deployment example (shows AWSCC + AWS provider usage)

## How This Was Generated

This file was generated by asking Amazon Q:
```
Generate usage example for awscc_appconfig_deployment
```

## Note on Mixed Provider Examples

The `appconfig_deployment.tf` example shows how some AWSCC resources require supporting resources from the standard AWS provider. This is common for complex services where the AWSCC resource represents the final deployment step.

This example demonstrates:
- Complete AppConfig setup workflow
- Using both AWS and AWSCC providers together
- Proper terraform/provider block configuration
- Realistic resource dependencies

## Validation

This example has been validated with:
```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
```

## Usage

You can use this as a reference for:
- Understanding complex AWSCC resource patterns
- Learning how AWSCC and AWS providers work together
- Seeing proper terraform/provider block usage
- Understanding realistic resource dependencies

## Testing

To test this example:
1. Copy the `.tf` file to a new directory
2. Run `terraform init`
3. Run `terraform validate`
4. Run `terraform plan`
5. Optionally run `terraform apply` (remember to `terraform destroy` afterward)
